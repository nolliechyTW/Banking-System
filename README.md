# Banking System with OOP
Create a banking system demo for managing customers and their bank accounts. <br/>

This project demonstrates a simple banking system implemented using *Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)* principles. The system comprises three classes: BankAccount, Customer, and Bank. It enables customers to create and manage their accounts, make deposits and withdrawals, and view account information. <br/>

## Features:

1. BankAccount class:<br/>
- Represents checking or savings accounts, with instance variables for account type, balance, and associated customer. 
- Provides methods for deposits and withdrawals, ensuring balance constraints. 
- Offers account information retrieval.

2. Customer class: <br/>
- Represents bank customers, with instance variables for name and address. 
- Includes methods to set and retrieve the customer's address.

3. Bank class: <br/>
- Serves as the main class, managing customer accounts and facilitating account operations. 
- User input is collected for name and address. Customer and account creation, along with deposits and withdrawals, are managed. 
- Account information is displayed after each transaction.

## Future Scope:
The banking system serves as a foundation for adding advanced features such as interest calculations, transaction history, and multi-user support. It is a valuable resource for learning OOP concepts and can be used as a starting point for developing sophisticated banking applications.
